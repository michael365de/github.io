### So it begins... ###

I started (or tried to) start learning C# two weeks ago with some youtube videos, but somehow did not get into the right
mood to start out seriously.
Then I stumbled over this Tweet by Scott Hanselmann :

I really like [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and tried it last year to learn some javascript. In combination with content from Microsoft Learn this seems like a great way to finally start digging into C#.

The first module starts out with the basics like variables and string formatting. It was nice to work through it interactive in a browser session. Everything was well explained and there was a guided project to put all things learned together and build a console application to calculate student grades.

## Here are my key takeaways from this first module ##

After two evenings and about 5 hours I have now completed the first of seven modules and earned my first badge :-)
I will write about my experience with the other modules after I have completed them.

ItÂ´s fun to learn this language and I think it will be valuable skill that expands my capabilities to build solutions
outside of (or next to) PowerApps.

If you are eager to learn C#, then this is a great course to get started.
