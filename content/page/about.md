My name is Michael Pucknat. I live with my wife, two kids and my beagle in the Rhine-Main area in Germany and in my current job role I work as a consultant for all things regarding Microsoft 365 in enterprise environments.

When I'm not working, I like to spend time with my family, cooking, playing video games and learn new things.



### Why I am writing this

I've been working in IT for over 20 years now. 

But actually it all started much earlier. When I was 9 years old, we had a Commodore VIC-20 at home that my mother had bought.
I sat next to her while she typed listings from computer magazines and watched what happened on the screen.
Later we had the first PC and I began to type code from books in BASIC and made my first attempts with DOS (sorry mum, that I formatted the harddisk and
formatted the hard disk and cost you x hours of work). 
A few years later I bought a book about Visual BASIC and built a small application that could display pictures and play music.
It was cool how relatively simple and with little code a real app could be created.

Fast forward a few years and at some point the question comes what job you want to do and IT was kind of obvious.
 
My first steps where in a small company where the servers were still assembled by hand. During this time I learned a lot about the setup
and administration of on-premise architectures, and through many long days and nights I gained more experience. 
After a few years I had already done many projects and became a teamleader.

There was always something new to learn and I realized that I also enjoyed passing on my learned knowledge to others in the team.
At some point, the cloud came along. It was exciting to watch the evolution of how BPOS became today's Microsoft 365.

And there it was, the Power Platform with its possibilities. When I tried PowerApps for the first time, I was captivated by it.
I was captivated by it, just as I was when I typed out listings and built a program in VBA according to instructions. Only now so much more was possible.

I have always been interested and motivated since the beginning of my IT career, but this was a new spark and the beginning of a new learning phase.

In addition to interesting technologies, I've encountered a great, open community while I went further down the rabbit hole of blogs and social media. 

**I was able to learn so much from the tweets and blogs of other people and I would like to give something back.** 

I hope that I can help those who are still at the very beginning by writing about my learning and thus support them.
 
Maybe it will help you if I post a link here, or a mistake I made so you don't have to. 

I want to share my experiences here and motivate people to keep learning too.

Thank you for reading this.

Michael
